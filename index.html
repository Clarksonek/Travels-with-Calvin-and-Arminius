    <h2>About This Work</h2>
    <p>This detailed study takes readers on a journey exploring the theological frameworks of John Calvin and Jacobus Arminius. It presents key arguments with biblical references, while also offering questions for individual reflection and group discussion. Designed to encourage deeper interaction with the material, it equips students, pastors, and lay Christians to better understand both perspectives and to engage in thoughtful dialogue. Extensive footnotes and references provide further resources for study.</p>
    
    <h2>About the author</h2>
    <p>David Clarkson trained as a scientist and pursued a career in education, serving for many years and concluding as Headteacher of a large comprehensive school. Alongside this, he has spent more than sixty years teaching and preaching the Bible in local churches and in Tilsley Bible college, Scotland. He has also co-authored books on Christian leadership and pastoral care.</p>
    
    <p>He writes not as an academic specialist, but as a lifelong student of Scripture whose ministry has been shaped by both study and experience. His aim is not to win arguments for one side or the other, but to explain clearly what Calvinists and Arminians believe, highlight the real points of difference, and encourage readers to weigh the issues thoughtfully for themselves.</p>
