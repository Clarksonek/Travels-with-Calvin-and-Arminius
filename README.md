Drawing on the relevant Scripture passages, historical context, and key theological arguments, this resource equips students, pastors, and lay Christians to explore these two traditions side by side. It is written in an easy-to-understand style, yet clearly outlines the issues. With reflection or discussion questions at the end of each section, it is ideal for personal study, classroom use, or group discussion — encouraging thoughtful interaction and deeper understanding of a topic that continues to influence the life of the church.
